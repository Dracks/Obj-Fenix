Classes How it works:
	Stackable: All Elements that can saved in the cpuStack
	  => Class: All Clases, it  know that we have methods and propieties, that can be visible in OFXClass and BuiltInClass. 
	    => BuiltInClass:
	      => CBoolean: Is a factory that can create a new boolean instance in a easy method
		    => Boolean: Is a copy of CBoolean, but it has value. 
		=> OFXClass: This contains all the information about a OFXClass, and generate the OFXInstance of this class when is needed.
		  => OFXInstance: This class, in a copy of OFXClass, but it contains the information of the instance in the code. 
      => Method: Its a capsule for know what method will be called in the CPU
	    => BuiltInMethod: It only contains the basic information about the Method, who call. In this case, it calls a BuiltInClass Method. It needs to save the original class, for the herence.
		=> OFXMethod: Contains the information for call a Obj-Fenix Method, the line of the code, and if the method is a constructor. 


StartWork:
--> Load File .ofx
	=> Charge Header. Verify header, and prepare options
	=> Charge Classes. Class By Class:
		=> charge Name and UID, define it in the library.
		=> load Methods. Method By Method:
			=> Assign and save the method to the class. 
				* If is a native Method, use the BuiltInMethod class.
				* else use OFXMethod.
